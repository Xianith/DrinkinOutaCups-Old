	<h1>Another Month of Carnage!</h1><i>05/16/2013</i>
	<br /><hr />
	We would like to thank JoeyDayMule for being gracious enough with the donation that will keep us going for another month! We are in the process of making our donation page more appealing, including a list of donors. Our server is run off of donations and wouldn't be around for long with great people like Joey.

	<br/><br />We have already recieved donations for the next month, but we would like to encourge everyone to donate if you can. If we reach a threshold of 100$ we will upgrade the server to 60 slots! Any left over donations will be used to pay for any further upgrades or monthly bills.

	<br/><br />Again, thanks for choosing to play on the Dirnkin Outa Cups server. We hope you enjoy your stay.
